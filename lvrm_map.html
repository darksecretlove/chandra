    The <a href="kitchen2.html">kitchen</a> is noteworthy in that it is a sensible kitchen, rather than four walls, a floor, and a ceiling for artwork.<br><br>
    The stairway up leads to the part of the studio that Chandra rents out.<br><br>
    The <a href="lroom1.html">living room</a> has more art than I have pictures... we ran out of film in the other rooms. I love the floor!<br><br>
