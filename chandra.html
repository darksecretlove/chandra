    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first heard of Chandra when a gallery announced an exhibit of her work. The painting on the postcard was dark, grainy, and had a twisted sense of aesthetics. What more can I say? It was love at first sight.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I found that she was participating in the ProArts Open Studios, so I decided to make the long trek to see her artwork before the exhibit.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stepped into Chandra's studio, my breath literally caught. Her studio walls were covered with gorgeous artwork which I feel unworthy and unable to describe in words.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was strangely disappointed with the gallery exhibit afterwards. In her studio, the layout of so many pieces in a small area created an intense, overwhelming effect that was missing in the gallery. I also like the cluttered, personal look where the backdrop is composed of other pieces and workspace rather than plain wall.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thought was the impetus for this website. This site is nothing more than a tribute to the beauty of Chandra's studio: no resume, no interview, no titles. If you want more information about her, visit her <a href="http://www.vspcity.com/gallery/chandra/">other website</a>.<br />
